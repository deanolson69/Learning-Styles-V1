# Learning Preferences Finder (Streamlit)

This is a simple Streamlit web app that helps users identify learning **preferences** using a VARK-style questionnaire:
- Visual
- Aural (Auditory)
- Read/Write
- Kinesthetic (Hands-on)

## Option A: Run locally (quick test)
1) Install Python 3.10+  
2) In this folder, run:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - streamlit run app.py

## Option B: Share with friends/family (recommended)
Use Streamlit Community Cloud to host it for free.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub repo
1) Go to GitHub and create a new repository (public is simplest).
2) Upload these two files to the repo:
   - app.py
   - requirements.txt

### Step 2: Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud
1) Go to Streamlit Community Cloud and connect your GitHub.
2) Create a new app:
   - Repository: (your repo)
   - Branch: main
   - Main file path: app.py
3) Deploy.

You will get a shareable URL that works on desktop and mobile browsers.

## Notes
- This app focuses on learning preferences rather than claiming a single fixed learning style.
